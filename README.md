# Common-Graph-Problems
Common graph problems implementation on Python with NetworkX library.   
## Implemented algorithms:  
MST (Minimum Spanning Tree):
* Kruskal algorithm
* Prim's algorithm
Shortest path (with negative edges):  
* Bellman-Ford algorithm
* Floyd-Warshall algorithm
Additionally Implemented modules:
* time_test.py - for time comparison with NetworkX algorithms implementations
* graph.py - customizable random graph generator (number of nodes, is_directed, fullness); graph vizualization included  
*TO DO*  
*ML Decision Tree classifier*
