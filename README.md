# Common-Graph-Problems
Common graph problems implementation on Python with NetworkX library.   
## Implemented algorithms:  
#### MST (Minimum Spanning Tree):
* Kruskal algorithm
* Prim's algorithm  
*analysis and conclusion can be found here: MSTandShortestPath.ipynb* 
#### Shortest path (with negative edges):  
* Bellman-Ford algorithm
* Floyd-Warshall algorithm  
*analysis and conclusion can be found here: MSTandShortestPath.ipynb*   
#### Decision Tree Classifier:  
* DecisionTreeClassiffier.ipynb
#### Additionally Implemented modules:
* time_test.py - for time comparison with NetworkX algorithms implementations
* graph.py - customizable random graph generator (number of nodes, is_directed, fullness); graph vizualization included
